## Problem Statement
Manual diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is:
- Time-consuming for radiologists
- Prone to human error  
- Challenging in resource-limited settings

**Solution:** Develop an AI system to assist medical professionals with rapid, automated diagnosis.

## Dataset
Used a curated dataset of chest X-rays with 4 classes:
- COVID-19
- Normal
- Viral Pneumonia  
- Lung Opacity



## Technical Approach

### Pre-processing Pipeline
1. **Image Enhancement**
   - Histogram Equalization (HE)
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive HE)
   - Image Complement

2. **Lung Segmentation**  
   - U-Net model for mask generation
   - ROI extraction by masking

3. **Standardization**  
   - Resized to 224Ã—224 pixels

### Model Architecture
- **Transfer Learning** with:
  - EfficientNetB0
  - VGG19
- Custom CNN layers for fine-tuning
- Trained with Adam optimizer

## Results
| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| EfficientNetB0 | 77.9%    | 77.4%     | 77.9%  |  76.0%   |  94.0%  |
| VGG19          | 81.4%    | 82.0%     | 94.7%  |  81.5%   |  94.8%  |
